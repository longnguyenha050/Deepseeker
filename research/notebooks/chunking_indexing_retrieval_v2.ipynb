Cách đo kích thước bàn chân chính xác nhất (tại nhà) \\nDụng cụ cần chuẩn bị: \\n• Một tờ giấy A4 trắng \\n• Bút chì / bút bi \\n• Thước kẻ (thước dây hoặc thước thẳng) \\n• Tất bạn thường mang khi đi giày (nên đo cùng loại tất) \\nCác bước thực hiện: \\n1. Đặt chân lên tờ giấy, gót chân sát mép giấy. \\n2. Giữ bút thẳng đứng, vẽ viền quanh bàn chân (từ gót đến đầu ngón dài nhất). \\n3. Đo chiều dài từ điểm xa nhất của gót đến đầu ngón chân dài nhất (thường là ngón \\ncái hoặc ngón giữa). \\n4. Đo chiều rộng tại điểm rộng nhất của bàn chân (thường ở phần trước bàn chân). \\n5. Lặp lại với cả hai chân → chọn số đo lớn hơn (chân thường chênh lệch nhẹ). \\n6. Thêm khoảng dư: \\no Giày thể thao / sneaker: + 0.5 – 1 cm \\no Giày tây / giày da: + 0.3 – 0.7 cm \\no Dép / sandal: + 0 – 0.5 cm \\nLưu ý: Đo vào buổi chiều hoặc tối vì chân thường nở to hơn buổi sáng khoảng 0.5 cm. \\n2.

Bảo quản theo chất liệu \\nA. Giày da thật (da bò, da bê, da lộn, nubuck) \\n• Lau bụi bằng khăn mềm khô hàng ngày. \\n• Nếu bẩn → dùng khăn ẩm lau nhẹ, sau đó lau khô ngay lập tức. \\n• Dùng xi đánh giày / dưỡng da định kỳ 1–2 tháng/lần (chọn màu phù hợp). \\n• Tránh để giày ướt lâu → nhét giấy báo hút ẩm, để nơi thoáng mát tự khô (không \\nphơi nắng). \\n• Không dùng hóa chất mạnh (nước tẩy, xăng, acetone) → dễ làm hỏng da. \\n• Bảo quản da l ộn/nubuck → dùng bàn ch ải chuyên d ụng, xịt chống thấm nước \\ntrước khi mang. \\nB. Giày vải / canvas (Converse, Vans, giày thể thao vải) \\n• Lau bụi bằng khăn khô hoặc chổi mềm. \\n• Nếu bẩn nặng → pha nư ớc ấm + xà phòng trung tính, dùng bàn ch ải mềm chà \\nnhẹ, rửa sạch, để khô tự nhiên (nhồi giấy báo để giữ form). \\n• Tránh ngâm nước lâu hoặc giặt máy → dễ bung keo, phai màu. \\n• Xịt chống thấm nước trước khi mang nếu hay đi mưa. \\nC. Giày thể thao (sneaker, giày chạy bộ, giày bóng đá) \\n• Tháo dây giày và lót trong để vệ sinh riêng. \\n• Lau đế bằng khăn ẩm + xà phòng nhẹ. \\n• Phần thân giày → tùy chất liệu (da/vải/mesh) áp dụng cách trên. \\n• Không phơi nắng trực tiếp → dễ vàng ố phần midsole (đế giữa). \\n• Dùng túi hút ẩm hoặc baking soda để khử mùi hôi. \\nD.
